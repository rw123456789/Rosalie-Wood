  <p> I am Rosalie (Rozz-al-ee) Wood. I am interested in unusual thinking and exciting applications within design, analogue and digital.
    The two central aspects of my practice are wit and empathy - the capacity to engage with anyone is achieved through humour.
    Engaging with people is not just achieved with static imagery, it is through concepts, video, projection mapping, installations, experience.
    I think I am exciting as a practitioner because I am capable of creating these unusual, relevant experiences.
