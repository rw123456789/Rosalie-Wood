  <p> I am a graphic artist interested in exploring vast digital and analogue terrain. I am currently studying Graphics at Manchester School of Art and thoroughly enjoying myself. The two central aspects of my practice are wit and empathy. After reading Beryl McAlhones' A Smile in the Mind my life changed forever. I believe that the capacity to engage with anyone from any walk of life is achieved through humour.Engaging with people is not just achieved with static imagery, it is through concepts, video, projection mapping, installations, experience. I think I am exciting as a practitioner because I am capable of creating these unusual, relevant experiences. Open to commissions and collaborations.
